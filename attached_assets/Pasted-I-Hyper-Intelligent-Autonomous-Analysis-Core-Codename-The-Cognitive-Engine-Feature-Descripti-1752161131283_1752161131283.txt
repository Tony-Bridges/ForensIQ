I. üß† Hyper-Intelligent & Autonomous Analysis Core
Codename: The Cognitive Engine

Feature	Description
Self-Learning Behavior Models	UBA + system/network profiles that evolve continuously; no hardcoded thresholds
Explainable AI (XAI)	For every flagged event, explain causality via feature attribution and logical trace
Hypothesis Generation Engine	Suggests forensic scenarios (insider exfiltration, ransomware, APT infiltration) and validates them
Digital Twin Reconstruction	Replay breach scenarios, simulate counterfactuals, test tool interference impact

Frameworks: PyTorch/XAI + Neo4j for hypothesis graphing + D3.js for visual twin replay

II. üïµÔ∏è Counter-Forensics & Adversary Emulation Module
Codename: Predator Reflex

Feature	Description
Anti-Forensic Technique Detection	Identify timestomping, slack space overwrites, and log wiping
TTP Emulation (MITRE ATT&CK)	Simulate how known APT groups operate on extracted artifacts
Deobfuscation AI	Detect polymorphic malware, dynamic code loaders, or sandbox-aware malware
C2 Channel Prediction	Use threat intel + behavior patterns to predict next hop or channel activation
Adversarial Path Reversal	Trace lateral movement and infrastructure setup backward from impact site

III. üßø Post-Quantum & Cryptographic Intelligence
Codename: Quantum Contingency Core

Feature	Description
Quantum Readiness Scanner	Identify weak cryptography (RSA-2048, SHA-2) in current corp data
PQC Signature Validator	Accepts and verifies evidence integrity using post-quantum schemes (e.g., Dilithium)
Quantum Artifact Detector (Future-Edge)	Watch for early quantum noise patterns in timing or compute footprint
Evidence Re-Hardening Assistant	Suggests PQC re-signing or re-encryption pipelines for legacy archives

IV. ‚öñÔ∏è Legal-Grade Autonomous Compliance Engine
Codename: Forensic Legislator

Feature	Description
Jurisdictional Rule Engine	Adjusts analysis & storage by local law (e.g., ‚Äúdon‚Äôt scan this drive; it‚Äôs under French data law‚Äù)
Auto-Admissibility Formatter	Reports match formats for UK Crown Court, US Federal, EU GDPR audit, etc.
Bias & Fairness Audits (Ethical AI)	Check ML models for racial, gender, language, or access bias before issuing conclusions
Expert Witness Simulation	Translates findings into affidavit-ready testimony complete with confidence scores

V. üåê Federated, Interoperable, Decentralized Ecosystem
Codename: ForensicNet Grid

Feature	Description
Blockchain-Tethered Artifact Sharing	Share only hashes/metadata in a tamperproof distributed graph (ZK-verified if needed)
Federated Intelligence Mesh	Query other trusted nodes: ‚ÄúHave you seen this malware DNA before?‚Äù without raw data leaks
Forensics-as-a-Service Gateway	Plug into malware reverse engineering APIs, cloud-specific artifact extractors
OSINT + Dark Web Correlation Engine	Check leaks, actor chatter, tool references via dark web APIs, open archives, Telegram groups
Cross-Sovereignty Attack Attribution	Combine OSINT + forensic + geopolitical context for actor linkage (APT, criminal, hacktivist)
